/**
 * In webpack jargon: a compilation object represents a build of versioned
 * &#x60;assets&#x60;. The &#x60;compilation.assets&#x60; property of a compilation is a map of
 * filepaths -&gt; asset objects. Each asset object has a property &#x60;source()&#x60; that
 * returns a string of that asset.
 *
 * &#x60;source&#x60; and &#x60;size&#x60; are the only required properties of a webpack asset.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} WebpackAsset
 *
 * @property {Function} source Returns a string representation of the asset that
 *           will be written to the file system (or generated in-memory) by
 *           webpack.
 * @property {Function} size Returns the byte size of the asset &#x60;source&#x60; value.
